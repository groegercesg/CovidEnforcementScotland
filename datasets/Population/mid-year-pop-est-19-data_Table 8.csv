1) National Health Service Central Register (NHSCR) patient movements mid-2018 to mid-2019.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2) The migration figures in this table are not rounded unlike other tables in this publication and are provided to allow users to compare age breakdowns. The fact that they are unrounded does not suggest they are of a higher level of accuracy than rounded statistics. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"3) Totals are based primarily on International Passenger Survey (IPS) data. However, the sample size in Scotland is too small to give an age breakdown so an age distribution is assumed using NHSCR data. ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
