Notes,,,,,,,,,,
"Counts of births and deaths at mid-year feed into the population estimates. They are based on provisional data before vital events data is finalised for the year, however it is unlikely there has been much change between the provisional and final counts. Data is rounded to the nearest 100.",,,,,,,,,,
