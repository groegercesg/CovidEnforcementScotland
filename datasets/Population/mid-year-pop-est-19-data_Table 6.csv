Footnotes,,,,,,,,,,,
1) Area codes refer to the 2019 Council areas and 2019 NHS Board areas. ,,,,,,,,,,,
"2) Population estimates for mid-2009 are based on the 2011 Council areas and 2014 NHS Board areas, whereas mid-2019 population estimates are based on the 2019 Council areas and NHS Board areas. The 2019 areas differ from the previous areas due to a boundary change at Cardowan by Stepps, between Glasgow and North Lanarkshire council areas (Greater Glasgow and Clyde and Lanarkshire health board areas). The boundary change resulted in approximately 400 people transferring from Glasgow to North Lanarkshire. These moves have been accounted for as migration within Scotland.",,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,
"3) Estimated net civilian migration includes movements within Scotland, the rest of the UK and overseas. Moves to and from armed forces are included in 'other changes'. Net migration totals have been rounded to the nearest ten at administrative area level, and the nearest hundred at national level. This may result in the sum of administrative area data differing from the national totals.",,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,
"4) Includes changes in the number of prisoners, armed forces stationed in Scotland, unattributable changes between mid-2009 and mid-2011 and a rounding adjustment.",,,,,,,,,,,
