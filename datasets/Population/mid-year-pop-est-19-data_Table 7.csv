"1) 2019 Council areas and 2019 NHS Board areas. The 2019 areas differ from the previous areas due to a boundary change at Cardowan by Stepps, between Glasgow and North Lanarkshire council areas (Greater Glasgow and Clyde and Lanarkshire health board areas). The boundary change resulted in approximately 400 people transferring from Glasgow to North Lanarkshire. These moves have been accounted for as migration within Scotland.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
