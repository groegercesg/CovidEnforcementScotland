Footnotes,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"1) 2019 Council areas and 2019 NHS Board areas. The 2019 areas differ from the previous areas due to a boundary change at Cardowan by Stepps, between Glasgow and North Lanarkshire council areas (Greater Glasgow and Clyde and Lanarkshire health board areas). The boundary change resulted in approximately 400 people transferring from Glasgow to North Lanarkshire. These moves have been accounted for as migration within Scotland.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"2) Migration totals have been rounded to the nearest ten at administrative area level, and the nearest hundred at national level. This may result in the sum of council area data differing from the national totals.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"3) The total in- and out-migration figures for Scotland equal the sum of migration from / to the rest of the UK and overseas. However, they do not equal the sum of moves for individual Council or NHS Board areas. Migration for individual Council and NHS Board areas includes people moving within Scotland. Since such moves do not involve anyone leaving or entering Scotland, they are not counted in the Scotland totals.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
